# Sprint 1 Brief

## Program Snapshot
ACM Introduces: the DevSprint program! If you are looking for resume-building developer experience with current tools in a low-stakes, collaborative, constructive, and growth-centered environment, this is the place for you! Working on a 4-week rotation between projects and workshops, students will have the opportunity to build and present up to 3 unique, 2-week-long projects. Our first program meeting is this upcoming Wednesday after the ACM Meeting on September 10th. Hope to see you there learning, building, and failing with style B)

## Client Prompt
The client is asking for a new feature for their music company. Hereâ€™s our stubs for a web-app that recommends songs.

## Working Goals
- Understand the user problem: who needs recommendations and why?
- Sketch the recommendation flow (input form, recommendation display, feedback loop).
- Implement the placeholder services so the UI can surface real data.
- Collect feedback from users and iterate during the two-week sprint.

## Definition of Done (Draft)
- Users can enter preferences (mood, genre, tempo, era, etc.).
- System returns at least five recommendations sourced from real or mock data.
- Users can like/dislike songs to refine future suggestions.
- Documentation explains how the recommendations are generated.

Update this brief as the sprint evolves.
